# About Me
My name is Alanna but I go by Lana. I am a college student looking forward to learning about cybersecurity and how to keep our internet safe from all harmful tactics. I hope to create my website to be useful and creative enough for people to enjoy when they come across my page. 
## My hobbies
In my spare time, I enjoy writing, listening to music, reading, gaming, and spending quality time with my family!
## My websites
[Visit Google](https://www.google.com/) I find Google helpful for researching or finding information leisurely.
[Entertainment](https://www.netflix.com/) I use Netflix for entertainment purposes and finding good shows/movies to watch when I'm alone or with peers.
